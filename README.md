# Topic Modeling and Labeling of NIPS Papers 

## Overview 
This project aims to perform the natural language processing task of topic modeling in regards to the NIPS papers dataset. The dataset comprises papers from the Neural Information Processing Systems conference, a leading conference covering innovative topics in machine learning and artificial intelligence. This dataset consists of 1500 papers, with six columns highlighting information about the titles, the year of publication, abstracts that offer a brief overview, the full content of the documents, and other details.

The project is designed into two parts for analysis. The first section intends to treat the entire NIPS papers dataset as one corpus and identify the top n topics with their corresponding word distributions through various topic modeling algorithms. In the second section, the dataset is split into three time periods and analyzes the evolution of machine learning topics based on the topics and word distributions generated from the algorithms.
